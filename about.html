									<h1>About Me</h1>
									<p>A little about me. I grew up in Southern California where I started my passion in mountain biking, strength training, and venturing outdoors. I studied engineering and coding principles in highschool, and sought out CU to further my career interests in Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering, alongside my hobies. I started and ran my own mountain	biking club in highschool raise awareness in my community about a that sport I am passoinate about. Since then I have engaged in the mountain bike community in a number of ways; including volunteer coaching, volunteer proctoring, and working as a bike shop mechanic. Recently I've coached part time for a youth mountain bike group in Boulder.
									</p>
									<p>
										I am an active engineer in training, with expertise in mechanical systems and software solutions. I have backgrounds in both mechanical and computer engineering; with my mechanical experience being focused around process flow, manufacturing, component design, and system integration. Where as my computer science history involves game, software, and VR development. I am a critical thinker, detail oriented, and enjoy working in teams. I aspire to be in managerial positions and be financially secure in my career.

								<p>I have had practice in developing websites using HTML, embedded JS, and various file types. The first website I <br />
									built as part of a group revolved around the idea of being a social transportation service for getting to <br />
									mountain resorts. Each user had a profile, can declare themselves as a driver or passenger, and can post to <br />
									onsite discussion boards for traveling to various locations and mountain sports resorts. My contribution was <br />
									to develop how users would be able to talk and send messages to each other. </p>

									<p>My education with CAD and SolidWorks has allowed me to explore creating digital models of various complexity, <br />
									as well as develop my own original ideas. One such idea I had while in my Mech.E. Statics course was to design a <br />
									portable and photogenic bike stand. This stand works by propping up the bike by the crank at the pedal axel, <br />
									instead of by a wheel or frame mount. Using what I learned from completing my SolidWorks Associate Certification <br />
									in CAD allowed me to further develop my idea for this project. </p>
