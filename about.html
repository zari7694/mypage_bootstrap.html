									<h1>Intro</h1>
									<p>I am an active engineer in training, with degrees in Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering. My backgrounds in mechanical systems and software solutions compliment eachother nicely as I now pursue new roles in Controls Engineering related to automated manufacturing. My previous work experiences have introduced me to process flow in a manufacturing setting. I started in conrolled environments for food processing, but have since had the chance to operate in controled clean room environments for medical device manufacturing. I have had the opportunity to develop both the front-end interfaces that the operators use to run equipment, as well as the underlying code that controls the process. I am a critical thinker, detail oriented, and enjoy working in teams. My experiences at the technician level have inspired me to pursue more technical roles in the field.

									<h1>About Me</h1>
									<p>A little about me. I grew up in Southern California where I started my passion in mountain biking, strength 
									training, and venturing outdoors. I studied engineering and coding principles in highschool, and sought out CU 
									to further my career interests in Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering, alongside my hobies. I started 
									and ran my own mountain biking club in highschool to raise awareness in my community about a sport that I 
									am passoinate about. Since then I have continued to develop my other hobbies such as skiing and rock 
									climbing, but continuously engage with the mountain bike community. From volunteer coaching to volunteer 
									service at events, to working at the local bike shop as a mechanic. I feel fortunate to be able to pursue both my 
									passion for sports and my professional career in tandem.

									<p>I have had practice in developing websites using HTML, embedded JS, and various file types. The first website I 
									built as part of a group revolved around the idea of being a social transportation service for getting to 
									mountain resorts. Each user had a profile, can declare themselves as a driver or passenger, and can post to 
									onsite discussion boards for traveling to various locations and mountain sports resorts. My contribution was 
									to develop how users would be able to talk and send messages to each other. </p>

									<p>My education with CAD and SolidWorks has allowed me to explore creating digital models of various complexity,
									as well as develop my own original ideas. One such idea I had while in my Mech.E. Statics course was to design a 
									portable and photogenic bike stand. This stand works by propping up the bike by the crank at the pedal axel, 
									instead of by a wheel or frame mount. Using what I learned from completing my SolidWorks Associate Certification 
									in CAD allowed me to further develop my idea for this project. </p>
